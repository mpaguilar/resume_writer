    Template for rendering a certifications section in an HTML resume.

    This template generates an HTML structure for displaying certifications, 
    with conditional rendering based on settings provided by the user.

    Args:

        certifications (list of Certification): A list of Certification objects to be rendered.

        2. For each certification in the certifications list:
           a. Renders an <h2> tag for "Certification".
           b. Conditionally renders fields based on settings:
              - name: if settings.name is True and certification.name exists
              - issuer: if settings.issuer is True and certification.issuer exists
              - issued: if settings.issued is True and certification.issued exists
              - expires: if settings.expires is True and certification.expires exists
              - certification_id: if settings.certification_id is True and certification.certification_id exists
        3. Each field is rendered in a <div> with a corresponding class.
