"""
This module provides functionality for parsing and processing resume content
with a focus on Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compatibility.

The primary purpose is to ensure that resume content is structured in a way
that is easily readable and interpretable by ATS software used by employers
to screen job applicants.

Functions:
    process_resume_for_ats(resume_text: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
        Processes a resume's raw text to extract and structure relevant
        information in a format optimized for ATS systems.

        Args:
            resume_text (str): The raw text content of a resume, typically
                extracted from a document file (PDF, DOCX, etc.). This text
                may contain unstructured or inconsistently formatted content.

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing structured resume data
                suitable for ATS processing. The dictionary includes keys for
                sections such as personal information, work experience,
                education, skills, and any other relevant fields.

        Notes:
            1. The function first validates that the input resume_text is a
               non-empty string.
            2. It then applies a series of parsing rules to identify and extract
               key resume sections based on common formatting patterns.
            3. Each section is normalized to a consistent format, including
               standardizing date formats and correcting common typos.
            4. The function performs a check to ensure that all required
               sections (e.g., work experience, education) are present.
            5. If any section is missing, the function adds a placeholder entry
               with a note indicating the missing data.
            6. The final structured output is returned as a dictionary.
            7. The function may access disk resources if the input text is
               read from a file path provided as a string.
            8. No network or database access is performed.
