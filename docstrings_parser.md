## `LabelBlockParse` class

Mixin for parsing blocks for labels.

Inheriting classes must implement `expected_fields` method, which
is a mapping between the label and the argument name for the
constructor.

Example:
-------
@staticmethod
def expected_fields() -> dict[str, str]:
    return {
        "school": "school",
        "degree": "degree",
        "start date": "start_date",
        "end date": "end_date",
    }

Args:
    parse_context: The current parsing context, containing lines to parse.

Returns:
    An instance of the class with parsed fields.

Notes:
    1. The parse_context is validated to ensure it is a ParseContext.
    2. A dictionary _expected_fields is retrieved from the class's expected_fields method.
    3. A dictionary _init_kwargs is initialized to store parsed field values.
    4. Each line in the parse_context is processed:
        a. Empty lines are skipped.
        b. Lines not containing a colon are skipped.
        c. The label part is extracted and converted to lowercase for lookup.
        d. If the label is in _expected_fields, the value is extracted, and the key-value pair is added to _init_kwargs.
        e. If the value is empty, it is skipped.
        f. Other non-empty lines are logged as skipped.
    5. Remaining keys in _expected_fields are added to _init_kwargs with None values.
    6. The parse_context is added to _init_kwargs.
    7. The class is instantiated with the populated _init_kwargs.

---
## method: `LabelBlockParse.parse(cls: T, parse_context: ParseContext) -> T`

Parse the block of lines into an object.

---
## `BasicBlockParse` class

Mixin for blocks containing a mix of top level blocks.

Subclasses must include two static methods:
* `expected_blocks`: a dictionary of block names and their init arg names
* `block_classes`: a dictionary of block names and the class to instanciate
for that block.

Example:
-------
@staticmethod
def expected_blocks() -> dict[str, str]:
    return {
        "basics": "basics",
        "description": "description",
        "responsibilities": "responsibilities",
        "skills": "skills",
    }

@staticmethod
def block_classes() -> dict[str, type]:
    return {
        "basics": RoleBasics,
        "description": RoleDescription,
        "responsibilities": RoleResponsibilities,
        "skills": RoleSkills,
    }

Args:
    parse_context: The current parsing context, containing lines to parse.

Returns:
    An instance of the class with parsed blocks.

Notes:
    1. The parse_context is validated to ensure it is a ParseContext.
    2. A dictionary _blocks is initialized to store parsed blocks.
    3. A variable _section_header is initialized to track the current section.
    4. Each line in the parse_context is processed:
        a. If the line starts with "# ", it is a section header, and _section_header is set.
        b. If there is no section header yet, the line is logged as unexpected.
        c. If the line does not start with "#", it is added to the current section.
    5. The section header is used to store the block context.
    6. After processing, the block contexts are converted to blocks using parse_blocks.
    7. The kwargs_parse method is called to process the blocks.
    8. The class is instantiated with the parsed kwargs.

---
## method: `BasicBlockParse.parse_blocks(cls: T, parse_context: ParseContext) -> dict[str, str]`

Parse the block of lines into a dictionary of blocks.

---
## method: `BasicBlockParse.kwargs_parse(cls: T, parse_context: ParseContext) -> dict[str, str]`

Mixin for blocks containing multiple blocks with the same name.

Args:
    parse_context: The current parsing context, containing lines to parse.

Returns:
    An instance of the class with a list of parsed objects.

Notes:
    1. The parse_context is validated to ensure it is a ParseContext.
    2. A list _blocks is initialized to store parsed block contexts.
    3. A variable _current_block is initialized to collect lines for the current block.
    4. A variable _section_header is initialized to track the current section.
    5. Each line in the parse_context is processed:
        a. Empty lines are skipped.
        b. Lines starting with "# " are section headers, and _section_header is set.
        c. If a new section header is found and _current_block is non-empty, it is added to _blocks.
        d. If _section_header is set, the line is added to _current_block.
    6. After processing, the last _current_block is added to _blocks if non-empty.
    7. The block contexts in _blocks are validated.
    8. The list_class method is called to get the type of the list items.
    9. Each block context is parsed into an object using the list_class type.
    10. The list of objects is returned as an instance of the class.

---
## method: `MultiBlockParse.parse_blocks(cls: T, parse_context: ParseContext) -> list[list[str]]`
